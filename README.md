This repository contains a collection of individual machine learning projects that I’ve worked on for practice and learning purposes. Since these are smaller, standalone projects, I’ve grouped them together here for easier access and organization.

Larger or more complex projects will have their own dedicated repositories to ensure clarity and better structure.
